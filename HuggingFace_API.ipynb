        "[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs) is an open‑source Python library that makes it easy to build a web‑based interface around any Python function, model, or API. With just a few lines of code you can wrap your machine‑learning model (or any processing function) into a usable UI and launch it locally or share it publicly. Gradio abstracts away the need for front‑end web development skills, enabling non‑technical users to interact with your model via browser input fields, sliders, image uploads, etc. Once your interface is running, you can also host it on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces so others can try it from anywhere.\n"

        "To give the chatbot a memory, you’ll need to keep *all* of the past messages (user + bot) in a list of dictionaries behind the scenes, and then include that history every time you make a new API call. Here’s step‑by‑step how you can do it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. At the top of your script (outside the function) create a variable, e.g.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   chat_history = []\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This will hold the sequence of all messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Each time the user sends a prompt, add a dictionary representing the user message to `chat_history`, e.g.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   chat_history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt})\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Then when you call the model, pass *all* of the previous messages + the current user message as the `messages` list. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   messages = chat_history.copy()\n",
        "   messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": ???})  # you’ll do this after you get the response\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. After the model returns a response, take the assistant’s reply content and append another dictionary into `chat_history`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   chat_history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response_text})\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. That way, when you next ask “What’s my name?” or “What do I love?”, the history contains the earlier statement (“My name is Sarah and I love pizza.”) and then the question follows. The model sees the entire chain and can answer accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. If you want, you can limit how many past messages you keep (for token/efficiency reasons) by slicing the list (e.g., `chat_history = chat_history[-10:]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "By following those steps, your chatbot will “remember” previous messages in the conversation."
